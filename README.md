[Article Submission System](https://www.ijpe.latticescipub.com/article-submission-system/) 
Author (s) can submit articles electronically round the year. The Editors reserve the right to reject articles without sending them out for review. Submitted articles should not have been previously published or be currently under consideration for publication elsewhere. Briefs and research notes are not published in this journal. Submitted articles must be within the [scope](https://www.ijpe.latticescipub.com/aims-and-scope/) of the journal. All articles go through a double-blind [peer review process](https://www.ijpe.latticescipub.com/peer-review-policy/). 

After the final acceptance of the article, based upon the detailed review process and submission of required documents, the article will be published online immediately. However, the assignment of the article of specific issue (see [archive](https://www.ijpe.latticescipub.com/archive/)) will be taken up by the [editors](https://www.ijpe.latticescipub.com/editorial-board/) later; and the authors will be intimated accordingly. For theme based special issues, time bound special calls for articles will be announced.
